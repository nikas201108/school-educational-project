# Education Control App

## Description
The Education Control App is a Python-based program designed to incorporate effective learning methodologies into everyday study routines. By leveraging techniques such as Hermann Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve, users can create personalized tests either manually or with the help of AI and track their progress over time. The app also allows for flexible localization and styling customization.
