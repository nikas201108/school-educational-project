# FAQ

## 1. How do I get started with the application?
First, you need to install the latest version of Python and the required dependencies. Next, place your notes in the Notes folder. The Tests folder will store your tests. If you want access to neural network features, obtain an Auth Key for GigaChat access using Sber ID (https://developers.sber.ru/studio/registration).

## 2. What should I do if my tests don't appear in the program?
Check that your tests are named correctly. The name should follow this format: `{note name}.{test number}.json`. Additionally, ensure the test structure is properly formatted; otherwise, you may encounter an error.

## 3. How can I add a new language to the program?
Simply add the required file to the Localisation folder.

## 4. How can I add my own style to the program?
Just add your style to the Styles folder.

## 5. Are tests generated by the neural network saved?
Yes, they are temporarily saved in the `temp.json` file. You can copy it, rename it, and move it to the Tests folder.

## 6. What does the S parameter in settings control?
It determines how well you retain information upon first exposure. The higher the value, the slower the forgetting process will occur.

## 7. Is the .txt format supported for notes?
No, it is not supported.

## 8. The program crashes on launch. What should I do?
This is likely due to an issue with the program's interaction with a style file. Try deleting all styles from the Styles folder and run the program again. If the error persists, reinstall the program.

## 9. Instead of text, I see localization keys, and there is a warning about incorrect localization. What should I do?
Check if the localization file is not empty, ensure all brackets are properly closed, and verify that the keys are correctly written. If this doesn't resolve the issue, revert to the built-in English or Russian localization.

## 10. I'm having issues with screen resolution. What should I do?
Try adjusting the `width` and `height` parameters in the `.css` styles.
